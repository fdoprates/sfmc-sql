--- Create a data extension with the following fields:
-- Month - Text - 2 - Pk
-- Year - Text - 4 - PK
-- NewSubscribers - Number - Nullable
-- SentCount - Number - Nullable
-- TotalActiveSubscribersNow - Number - Nullable
-- InsertDate - Date - Nullable

--- if your org has a large amount of data, create one query per month and add all of them to Automation Studio. All queries should use the UPDATE format.
